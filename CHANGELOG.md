## 0.1.4

## 0.1.2

## 0.1.1
* Work around the app restarting on the last thing that was played
* Concatenation insert/remove/move support

## 0.1.0
* Ok so it was here after all, because I forgot to start it and make sure it was started. So that's fixed now.
* The "idle" state is more or less a "done" state, so I've made it not assume that it's done while it loads. So the player doesn't kill itself after every track now.
* In short, it should now work! (Note: it is undertested against network sources atm)

## 0.0.1-pre.1

* Pretty much all of the features.
* Not sure where the problem with load() not being called is but I'm pretty sure it's not here.
